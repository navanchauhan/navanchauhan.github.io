# Basic NFC Music Cards for iOS

I had a pack of NFC cards and decided it was the perfect time to create Music Cards. I do not have a "music setup."
So, I did not have to ensure this could work with any device. I settled with using Shortcuts personal Automation.

## Designing the Template

I tried measuring the card's dimensions with the in-built Measure app, but it was off by a few mm.

After measuring with a scale, I decided on a simple template I made in Apple Pages.

## Creating the Automation

I created a personal automation in the Shortcuts app which got triggered when a particular NFC card was scanned, ask playback destination and play the album/playlist.
