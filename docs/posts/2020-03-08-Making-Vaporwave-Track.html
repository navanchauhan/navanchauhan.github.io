	<h1>Making My First Vaporwave Track (Remix)</h1>

<p>I finally completed my first quick and dirty vaporwave remix of "I Want It That Way" by the Backstreet Boys</p>

<h1>V A P O R W A V E</h1>

<p>Vaporwave is all about A E S T H E T I C S. Vaporwave is a type of music genre that emerged as a parody of Chillwave, shared more as a meme rather than a proper musical genre. Of course this changed as the genre become mature</p>

<h1>How to Vaporwave</h1>

<p>The first track which is considered to be actual Vaporwave is Ramona Xavier's Macintosh Plus, this set the the guidelines for making Vaporwave</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a 1980s RnB song</li>
<li>Slow it down</li>
<li>Add Bass and Treble </li>
<li>Add again</li>
<li>Add Reverb ( make sure its wet )</li>
</ul>

<p>There you have your very own Vaporwave track.</p>

<p>( Now, there are some tracks being produced which are not remixes and are original )</p>

<h1>Where is the Programming?</h1>

<p>The fact that there are steps on producing Vaporwave, this gave me the idea that Vaporwave can actually be made using programming, stay tuned for when I publish the program which I am working on ( Generating A E S T H E T I C artwork and remixes)</p>
