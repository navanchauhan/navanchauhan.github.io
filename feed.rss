Because I can.</p><h2>Installing makedepend</h2><p><code>makedepend</code> is a Unix tool used to generate dependencies of C source files. Most modern programes do not use this anymore, but then again AutoDock Vina's source code hasn't been changed since 2011. The first hurdle came when I saw that there was no makedepend command, neither was there any package on any development repository for iOS. So, I tracked down the original source code for <code>makedepend</code> (https://github.com/DerellLicht/makedepend). According to the repository this is actually the source code for the makedepend utility that came with some XWindows distribution back around Y2K. I am pretty sure there is a problem with my current compiler configuration because I had to manually edit the <code>Makefile</code> to provide the path to the iOS SDKs using the <code>-isysroot</code> flag.</p><h2>Editting the Makefile</h2><p>Original Makefile ( I used the provided mac Makefile base )</p><pre><code><div class="highlight"><span></span><span class="nv">BASE</span><span class="o">=</span>/usr/local

This is literally the only reason I tried compiling it and also partially because in the long run I want to compile AutoDock Vina so I can do Molecular Docking on the go.</p><h2>Let's Go!</h2><p>How hard can it be to compile open babel right? It is just a simple software with clear and concise build instructions. I just need to use <code>cmake</code> to build and the <code>make</code> to install.</p><p>It is 11 AM in the morning. I install <code>clang, cmake and make</code> from the Sam Bingner's repository, fired up ssh, downloaded the source code and ran the build command.`clang</p><h3>Fail No. 1</h3><p>I couldn't even get cmake to run, I did a little digging arond StackOverflow and founf that I needed the iOS SDK, sure no problem. I waited for Xcode to update and transfered the <code>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS.sdk</code> to <code>/var/sdks/</code> on my iPad</p><p>Them I told cmake that this is the location for my SDK 😠. Succesful! Now I just needed to use make.</p><h3>Fail No. 2</h3><p>It was giving the error that thread-local-storage was not supported on this device.</p><pre><code><div class="highlight"><span></span><span class="o">[</span>  <span class="m">0</span>%<span class="o">]</span> Building CXX object src/CMakeFiles/openbabel.dir/alias.cpp.o

George McIntire (GH: @joolsa) has created a wonderful dataset containing the headline, body and wheter it is fake or real. Whenever you are looking for a dataset, always try searching on Kaggle and GitHub before you start building your own</p><h3>Dependencies</h3><p>I used a Google Colab instance for training my model. If you also plan on using Google Colab then I reccomend choosing a GPU Instance (It is Free) This allows you to train the model on the GPU. Turicreat is built on top of Apache's MXNet Framework, for us to use GPU we need to install a CUDA compatible MXNet package.</p><pre><code><div class="highlight"><span></span><span class="nt">!pip</span><span class="na"> install turicreate</span>

Abrams’ skillful pacing and faithfulness to George Lucas’ vision, which makes me wonder if I should just call the whole thing off. Now, I really don’t feel like camping outside his house for hours. Maybe I could go with a response that’s somewhere in between, like, threatening to kill his dog but not everyone in his whole family? I don’t know. This is a tough one.” At press time, sources reported that Ariely had resolved to wear his Ewok costume while he murdered the critic in his sleep.&quot;</span><span class="p">]}</span>

This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model. The problem is that these concepts do not apply to new data and negatively impact the models ability to generalize.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Source: Machine Learning Mastery</p></blockquote><p>Basically if you train your machine learning model on a small dataset for a really large number of epochs, the model will learn all the deformities/noise in the data and will actually think that it is a normal part. Therefore when it will see some new data, it will discard that new data as noise and will impact the accuracy of the model in a negative manner</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://navanchauhan.github.io/posts/2019-12-10-TensorFlow-Model-Prediction</guid><title>Making Predictions using Image Classifier (TensorFlow)</title><description>Making predictions for image classification models built using TensorFlow</description><link>https://navanchauhan.github.io/posts/2019-12-10-TensorFlow-Model-Prediction</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 11:10:00 +0530</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Making Predictions using Image Classifier (TensorFlow)</h1><p><em>This was tested on TF 2.x and works as of 2019-12-10</em></p><p>If you want to understand how to make your own custom image classifier, please refer to my previous post.</p><p>If you followed my last post, then you created a model which took an image of dimensions 50x50 as an input.</p><p>First we import the following if we have not imported these before</p><pre><code><div class="highlight"><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">cv2</span>

* Custom Icon Masks

**NOTE: This is an optional step, if you do not want Icon Masks, skip this step**

* Inside your `themeName.theme` folder, create another folder called 'Bundles'
  * Inside `Bundles` create another folder called `com.apple.mobileicons.framework`
  
#### Designing Masks

**Masking does not support IconBundles, therefore you need to save the masks for each of the following**

| File | Resolution |
|------|------------|
| AppIconMask@2x~ipad.png    | 152x512 |
| AppIconMask@2x~iphone.png    | 120x120 |
| AppIconMask@3x~ipad.png    | 180x180 |
| AppIconMask@3x~iphone.png    | 180x180 |
| AppIconMask~ipad.png    | 76x76 |
| DocumentBadgeMask-20@2x.png    | 40x40 |
| DocumentBadgeMask-145@2x.png    | 145x145 |
| GameAppIconMask@2x.png    | 84x84 |
| NotificationAppIconMask@2x.png    | 40x40 |
| NotificationAppIconMask@3x.png    | 60x60 |
| SpotlightAppIconMask@2x.png    | 80x80 |
| SpotlightAppIconMask@3x.png    | 120x120 |
| TableIconMask@2x.png    | 58x58 |
| TableIconOutline@2x.png    | 58x58 |

* While creating the mask, make sure that the background is not a solid colour and is transparent
* Whichever area you want to make visible, it should be coloured in black

### Packaging

* Create a new folder outside `themeName.theme` with the name you want to be shown on Cydia, e.g `themeNameForCydia`
* Create another folder called `DEBIAN` in `themeNameForCydia` (It needs to be uppercase)
* In `DEBIAN` create an extensionless file called `control` and edit it using your favourite text editor

Paste the following in it, replacing `yourname`, `themename`, `Theme Name`, `A theme with beautiful icons!` and `Your Name` with your details:

```
Package: com.yourname.themename
Name: Theme Name
Version: 1.0
Architecture: iphoneos-arm
Description: A theme with beautiful icons!
Author: Your Name
Maintainer: Your Name
Section: Themes
```

* Important Notes:
  * The package field **MUST** be lower case!
  * The version field **MUST** be changed everytime you update your theme!
  * The control file **MUST** have an extra blank line at the bottom!
  
* Now, Create another folder called `Library` in `themeNameForCydia`
* In `Library` create another folder called `Themes`
* Finally, copy `themeName.theme` to the `Themes` folder (**Copy the entire folder, not just the contents**)

### Building the DEB

**For building the deb you need a `*nix` system, otherwise you can build it using your iPhones**

##### Pre-Requisite for MacOS users
1) Install Homenbrew `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` (Run this in the terminal)
2) Install dpkg, by running `brew install dpkg`

**There is a terrible thing called .DS_Store which if not removed, will cause a problem durin either build or installation**

* To remove this we first need to open the folder in the terminal

* Launch the Terminal and then drag-and-drop the 'themeNameForCydia' folder on the Terminal icon in the dock
* Now, run `find . -name "*.DS_Store" -type f -delete`

##### Pre-Requisite for Windows Users
* SSH into your iPhone and drag and drop the `themeNameForCyia` folder on the terminal

##### Common Instructions

* You should be at the root of the folder in the terminal, i.e Inside `themeNameForCydia`
* running `ls` should show the following output

```
DEBIAN  Library
```

* Now, in the terminal enter the following `cd .. && dpkg -b themeNameForCydia `

**Now you will have the `themeNameForCydia.deb` in the same directory**
