## Resources

* For latest updates, [r/AR_MR_XR](https://reddit.com/r/AR_MR_XR) is one of the best resources out there.
* Until WebXR actually becomes a thing and gets support on Safari, depending on the use case any of the frameworks can be used right now with each having their own pros and cons. Otherwise, for displaying simple models Google's ModelViewer framework can be used to integrate with the native AR frameworks for both iOS and Android to display glTF/USDZ models.


## Ideas

### Safety Checklist for CUBRT

Would be nice to have an AR app/website that goes through all the safety checklists on our cars, so we never have to see another loose fuel line blow up the entire car. 

Possible solution: Add a fiduciary marker under the hood of the car and use it to highlight areas which need to be checked, or multiple markers which are activated in a particular order and show up as disabled until you complete the previous step.

### App Clips

Although App Clips on iOS have limited capabilities available to them, ARKit is one of them. This means, a QR code / NFC trigger can be used to launch a mini ARKit based App Clip.

### Non-AR Smart Glasses

Not every pair of smart glasses need to have AR based surface tracking / SLAM, to display stuff. Just a simple display which can overlay elements on the real world should be capable of displaying tons of data
