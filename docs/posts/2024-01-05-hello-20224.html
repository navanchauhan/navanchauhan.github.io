	<h1>Hello 2024</h1>

<p><code>2024 % 4 == 0</code></p>

<h2>2023</h2>

<p>Another revolution around the sun! This was a pretty fun and interesting year. I got to work on some interesting projects, and learned a lot.</p>

<p>I am going to try and use my GitHub activity to recap.</p>

<h3>Spring</h3>

<ul>
<li>I helped a friend modernize their Larvael codebase. Dockerized it for easier development, and added a CD pipeline. (Probably going to be released by end of this year)</li>
<li>I joined <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://hindsightjournal.org">Hindsight Journal</a>, a creative non-fiction club at CU as their "webmaster", and we moved away from Squarespace to our own custom static site generator.</li>
<li>I did some YunoHost stuff with listmonk, and audiobookshelf</li>
<li>I found out that the instructor for my astrophysics class was behind <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/threebodybot">@ThreeBodyBot</a>. For my final project, I ported the codebase to run in the browser itself. Ended up getting an A ðŸ˜Ž</li>
<li>Won HackCU, my first hackathon in a few years. We built a timeboxing app similar to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://usemotion.com">Motion</a> /  <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://reclaim.ai">Reclaim.AI</a>. Cleaned up the codebase and published it to the App Store as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://timeslicerx.prudent.studio">TimeSlicerX</a>, making it my first published app.</li>
<li>Got into Mountain Biking!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summer</h3>

<p>Summer was more relaxing. I mainly worked on some maintenance patches for my projects, and did some more freelancing stuff.</p>

<ul>
<li>Learned Tkinter for a client's project. Working with PyInstaller to create signed executables for both macOS and Windows was not fun. Also, the stock Tk look on Windows is terrible.</li>
<li>Continued working on a research project using Computer Vision in analysing a lateral flow assay. Tried porting it to use OpenCV.js, but it wasn't reliable enough. I might look into directly working with OpenCV/Vision Framework for an iOS app.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fall</h3>

<ul>
<li>Won a couple more hackathons. I might summarize my hackathon experience in a different blog post.</li>
<li>I gave up being the "webmaster" for Hindsight, and decided to become the club's business manager. We moved to Wix.</li>
<li>Had fun re-learning all the reverse engineering stuff for my Systems class.</li>
<li>Tried Advent of Code. Will be back :~)</li>
<li>Created an alternative to Simplify.Jobs and worked on autofilling resumes without needing a browser extension (Current solution does require that you disable a few security flags for this to work). One solution might be to wrap our website as an Electron application.</li>
<li>Started working on <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/navanchauhan/swift-gopher">swift-gopher</a> - a swift library for both client/server implementations for the Gopher protocol.</li>
<li>Ended up using swift-gopher to build <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.navan.dev/iGopherBrowser">iGopherBrowser</a> - a modern gopher client for iOS / macOS. This is my first publically availablle macOS app.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the end of the fall semester I ended up getting my wisdom tooth removed. Took me out for 10 days.</p>

<p>I also did a ton of other stuff, but I am not sure how much I want to be sharing on my blog here. Maybe as I write more I will get more comfortable with sharing more information.</p>

<h2>2024</h2>

<p>So, what are my plans for 2024? <strong>Learn. Build. Ship.</strong></p>

<p>Other goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continue homebrewing</li>
<li>Learn assembly</li>
<li>Get better at designing stuff</li>
<li>Improve my handwriting</li>
<li>Do a deeper dive into the math of Machine/Deep Learning, before I get back into it</li>
</ul>
