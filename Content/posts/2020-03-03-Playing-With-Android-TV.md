2. [Enable Developer Settings](#Developer-Settings)
3. [Enable ADB](#Enable-ADB)

## IP-Address


*These steps should be similar for all Android-TVs*

The other option is to go to your router's server page and get connected devices

## Developer-Settings

* Continously click on the "Build" option until it says "You are a Developer"

## Enable-ADB

* Go to Settings
* Go to Developer Options
* Scroll untill you find ADB Debugging and enable that option

## Connect-ADB

* Open Terminal (Make sure you have ADB installed)
* Enter the following command `adb connect <IP_ADDRESS>`
* To test the connection run `adb logcat`

## Manipulating Apps / Packages


### Listing Packages


*  `adb shell`
* `pm list packages`


### Installing Packages

### Uninstalling Packages


* `adb uninstall com.company.yourpackagename`
