# Colophon

This website is generated using a custom static site generator I wrote in Python. The theme is a port of [@mdo's Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/), ported by the makers of [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

All the Open Graph images are generated using Pillow and the Futura font. The math is taken care of by an extra I created for the python-markdown2 library that converts inline and block $\LaTeX$ into MathML.

Since this website is currently using the `.dev` tld, there is no support for HTTP in most browsers (Since they use HSTS preloading). But if you ever find yourself on an IBM PC 5150 and need to use `hget`, that should work.
