# About Me

Hi!

My name is Navan Chauhan. I do lots of different things. Most of the bigger projects I am working on are currently private/unlisted. Although, all of them will be open-sourced, I don't want to publish them until I am happy with the version 1.0.

Landing page with other links, and projects: [https://hi.navan.dev](https://hi.navan.dev)

## Contact Me

The best way to reach out to me is by e-mail. subject[at]navan.email Or, if I have made peace with my ISP and corrected the rDNS settings, then: hey[at]navan.dev

My GPG Fingerprint:

`1DA1 04AA DEB7 7473 A4FA C27B 4EFC A289 7342 A778`
