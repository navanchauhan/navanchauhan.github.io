# About Me

Hi! My name is Navan Chauhan. I dabble in the mysterious dark arts of programming and in-silico drug discovery. I am proficient in Python and can work my way with Swift. I only use vanilla JS.


## Contact Me

The best way to reach out to me is by e-mail. navanchauhan[at]gmail.com Or, if I have made peace with my ISP and corrected the rDNS settings, then: hey[at]navan.dev
