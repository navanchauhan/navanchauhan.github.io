# Making My First Vaporwave Track (Remix)

I finally completed my first quick and dirty vaporwave remix of "I Want It That Way" by the Backstreet Boys

# V A P O R W A V E 

Vaporwave is all about A E S T H E T I C S. Vaporwave is a type of music genre that emerged as a parody of Chillwave, shared more as a meme rather than a proper musical genre. Of course this changed as the genre become mature

# How to Vaporwave

The first track which is considered to be actual Vaporwave is Ramona Xavier's Macintosh Plus, this set the the guidelines for making Vaporwave

* Take a 1980s RnB song
* Slow it down
* Add Bass and Treble 
* Add again
* Add Reverb ( make sure its wet )

There you have your very own Vaporwave track.

( Now, there are some tracks being produced which are not remixes and are original )

# Where is the Programming?

The fact that there are steps on producing Vaporwave, this gave me the idea that Vaporwave can actually be made using programming, stay tuned for when I publish the program which I am working on ( Generating A E S T H E T I C artwork and remixes)
